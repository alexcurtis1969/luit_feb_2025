# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on two features: the number of rooms and the size of the house (in square feet). The model is implemented using Python's **scikit-learn** library and uses a **Linear Regression** algorithm to predict prices. The dataset is assumed to contain information about various houses, including the number of rooms, size, and price.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
- `scikit-learn` (for building and evaluating the machine learning model)

You can install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
